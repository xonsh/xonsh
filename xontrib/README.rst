Xontributions, or xontribs, are a set of tools and conventions for extending
the functionality of xonsh beyond what is provided by default. This allows
3rd party developers and users to improve their xonsh experience without
having to go through the xonsh development and release cycle.

This xontrib directory represents an implicit namespace package.
DO NOT add an __init__.py file to this directory.
