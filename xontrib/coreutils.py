"""Additional core utilities that are implemented in xonsh. The current list
includes:

* cat
* echo
* pwd
* tee
* tty
* yes

In many cases, these may have a lower performance overhead than the
posix command line utility with the same name. This is because these
tools avoid the need for a full subprocess call. Additionally, these
tools are cross-platform.
