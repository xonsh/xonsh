Xonsh (sounds like "consh") is a modern, full-featured and cross-platform python shell.
The language is a superset of Python 3 with seamless integration of shell functionality and commands.
It works on all major systems including Linux, OSX, and Windows.
Xonsh is meant for the daily use of experts and novices.
