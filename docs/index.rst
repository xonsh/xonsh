Xonsh is a Python-ish, BASHwards-looking shell language and command prompt.
The language is a superset of Python 3.4+ with additional shell primitives
that you are used to from Bash and IPython. It works on all major systems including
Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows. Xonsh is meant for the daily use of experts and novices 
alike.
