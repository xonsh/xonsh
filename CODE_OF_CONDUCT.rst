Xonsh Xode of Xonduct
=====================

Xonsh is an engaged and respectful community made up of people from all over the
world. Your involvement helps us to expand and strengthen our community and to
further the progress of ``xonsh`` and related tooling.

To quote one Anthony Scopatz:

    It turns out shells have a lot of tricky edge cases.

Add to this that shells are personal tools that invite customization. This, in
turn, invites lots of deeply-held convictions and strong opinions.  

These are all *good things*!

This implies diversity of ideas and perspectives on often complex
problems. Disagreement and healthy discussion of conflicting viewpoints is
welcome: the best solutions to hard problems rarely come from a single angle.
But disagreement is not an excuse for aggression: humans tend to take
disagreement personally and easily drift into behavior that ultimately degrades
a community. This is particularly acute with online communication across
language and cultural gaps, where many cues of human behavior are unavailable.
We are outlining here a set of principles and processes to support a
healthy community in the face of these challenges.

Fundamentally, we are committed to fostering a productive, harassment-free
environment for everyone. Rather than considering this code an exhaustive list
of things that you can’t do, take it in the spirit it is intended - a guide to
make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate.

Importantly: as a member of our community, *you are also a steward of these
values*.  Not all problems need to be resolved via formal processes, and often
a quick, friendly but clear word on an online forum or in person can help
resolve a misunderstanding and de-escalate things.

This code applies equally to founders, developers, mentors and new community
members, in all spaces managed by Xonsh. This includes all repositories in the
``xonsh`` GitHub organization, the mailing list, all chat rooms (Gitter and
IRC), and any other forums created by the project team. In addition, violations
of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to
participate within them.

.. note:: It is the strong opinion of the Xonsh developers that the maintainers
          and contributors of ``xontribs`` (Xonsh plugins / contributions) which
          are not underneath the ``xonsh`` organization should also abide by
          these rules.

=================
Expected behavior
=================

By embracing the following principles, guidelines and actions to follow or
avoid, you will help us make Xonsh a welcoming and productive community.

1. **Be friendly and patient**.

2. **Be welcoming**. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
   people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited
   to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color,
   immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual
   orientation, gender identity and expression, age, physical appearance, family
   status, technological or professional choices, academic
   discipline, religion, mental ability, and physical ability.

3. **Be considerate**. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
   will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users
   and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when
   making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community. You may be
   communicating with someone with a different primary language or cultural
   background.

4. **Be respectful**. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
   no excuse for poor behavior or poor manners. We might all experience some
   frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
   personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people
   feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

5. **Be careful in the words that you choose**. Be kind to others. Do not insult
   or put down other community members. Harassment and other exclusionary
   behavior are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
   * Violent threats or violent language directed against another person
   * Discriminatory jokes and language
   * Posting sexually explicit or violent material
   * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing")
   * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms
   * Unwelcome sexual attention
   * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
   * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop

6. **Moderate your expectations**. Please respect that community members choose
   how they spend their time in the project. A thoughtful question about your
   expectations is preferable to demands for another person's time.

7. **When we disagree, try to understand why**. Disagreements, both social and
   technical, happen all the time and Xonsh is no exception.  Try to
   understand where others are coming from, as seeing a question from their
   viewpoint may help find a new path forward.  And don’t forget that it is
   human to err: blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere, while we can learn
   from mistakes to find better solutions.

8. **A simple apology can go a long way**. It can often de-escalate a situation,
   and telling someone that you are sorry is an act of empathy that doesn’t
   automatically imply an admission of guilt.

====================================
Responding to inappropriate behavior
====================================

In some cases, individuals may violate the CoC in online or in-person situations.
If any community member deems the action to be harmful to the community,
they may act immediately to defuse the situation.
This includes actions directed at the situation, rather than at an individual, such
as locking a thread, *temporarily* suspending a user's account in the
community forum, calling a meeting break, or generally acting to
de-escalate the situation.

If the incident involves physical danger, or involves a threat to anyone's safety
(such as threats of violence), any member of the community may -- and should -- act
unilaterally to protect the safety of any community member.
This can include contacting law enforcement, other members of the Xonsh community,
or other local personnel that are present.

In situations where an individual community member acts unilaterally,
they must inform the Code of Conduct committee as soon as possible,
by emailing `xonduct@xon.sh <mailto:xonduct@xon.sh>`_.


=========
Reporting
=========

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, please report this in
a timely manner. Code of conduct violations reduce the value of the community
for everyone and we take them seriously.

You can file a report by emailing `xonduct@xon.sh <mailto:xonduct@xon.sh>`_.
Or by filling out this `form <form>`_

The online form gives you the option to keep your report anonymous or request
that we follow up with you directly. While we cannot follow up on an anonymous
report, we will take appropriate action.
