**Changed:**

* Accessing ``xonsh`` specific values(__xonsh__, aliases, ...) from ``builtins`` module is deprecated.
  They are available on ``xonsh.built_ins.XSH`` singleton and can be imported by python modules.
  ``*.xsh`` will have access to those variables in global scope. So those will continue to work.
