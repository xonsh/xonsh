**Added:**

* Starting form ``xonsh.api`` (#5383 #5538).

**Changed:**

* Big refactoring of internal modules structure to give clear understanding of internal xonsh components (#5538).

**Deprecated:**

* Starting from this release we notify that in the future we will not recommend to use ``xonsh.procs.run_subproc``
  and ``xonsh.built_ins.subproc_*`` functions for downstream projects because of #5383.
  We will develop ``xonsh.api`` as alternative.
