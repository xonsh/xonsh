The xonsh shell community
*************************

The xonsh shell is developed by a community of volunteers and has no organization that can get grants, donations or additional support. There are two major ways to help the xonsh shell: to spread the good word about xonsh in the world (`write a tweet`_) and to help improve the xonsh shell (`solve an issue <https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc>`_). We welcome new contributors!
