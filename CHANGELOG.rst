Xonsh Change Log
================

Current Developments
====================
**Added:**

* ``and``, ``or``, ``&&``, ``||`` have been added as subprocess logical operators,
  by popular demand!
* Subprocesses may be negated with ``not`` and grouped together with parentheses.
* New framework for writing xonsh extentions, called ``xontribs``.
* Added a new shell type ``'none'``, used to avoid importing ``readline`` or
  ``prompt_toolkit`` when running scripts or running a single command.
* New: `sudo` functionality on Windows through an alias
* Automatically enhance colors for readability in the default terminal (cmd.exe)
  on Windows. This functionality can be enabled/disabled with the
  $INTENSIFY_COLORS_ON_WIN environment variable.
* Added ``Ellipsis`` lookup to ``__xonsh_env__`` to allow environment variable checks, e.g. ``'HOME' in ${...}``
* Added an option to update ``os.environ`` every time the xonsh environment changes.
  This is disabled by default but can be enabled by setting ``$UPDATE_OS_ENVIRON`` to
  True.
* Added Windows 'cmd.exe' as a foreign shell. This gives xonsh the ability to source
  Windows Batch files (.bat and .cmd). Calling ``source-cmd script.bat`` or the
  alias ``source-bat script.bat`` will call the bat file and changes to the
  environment variables will be reflected in xonsh.
* Added an alias for the conda environment activate/deactivate batch scripts when
  running the Anaconda python distribution on Windows.
* Added a menu entry to launch xonsh when installing xonsh from a conda package
* Added a new ``which`` alias that supports both regular ``which`` and also searches
  through xonsh aliases. On Windows if the ``which`` binary is not available this will 
  fall back to using the ``where`` command 
* Added support for prompt toolkit v1.0.0.
* Added ``$XONSH_CACHE_SCRIPTS`` and ``$XONSH_CACHE_EVERYTHING`` environment
  variables to control caching of scripts and interactive commands.  These can
  also be controlled by command line options ``--no-script-cache`` and
  ``--cache-everything`` when starting xonsh.

**Changed:**

* Running scripts through xonsh (or running a single command with ``-c``) no
  longer runs the user's rc file, unless the ``--login`` option is specified.
  Also avoids loading aliases and environments from foreign shells, as well as
  loading bash completions.
* rc files are now compiled and cached, to avoid re-parsing when they haven't
  changed.  Scripts are also compiled and cached, and there is the option to
  cache interactive commands.
* Left and Right arrows in the ``prompt_toolkit`` shell now wrap in multiline
  environments
* Regexpath matching with backticks, now returns an empty list in python mode.
* Pygments added as a dependency for the conda package
* Foreign shells now allow for setting exit-on-error commands before and after
  all other commands via the ``seterrprevcmd`` and ``seterrpostcmd`` arguments.
  Sensinble defaults are provided for existing shells.
* PLY is no longer a external dependency but is bundled in xonsh/ply. Xonsh can
  therefore run without any external dependencies, although having prompt-toolkit
  recommended.

**Deprecated:** None

**Removed:** None

**Fixed:**

* Fixed bug with loading prompt-toolkit shell < v0.57.
* Fixed bug with prompt-toolkit completion when the cursor is not at the end of
  the line.
* Aliases will now evaluate enviornment variables and other expansions
  at execution time rather than passing through a literal string.
* Fixed environment variables from os.environ not beeing loaded when a running
  a script
* Fixed bug that prevented `source-alias` from working.
* Now able to ``^C`` the xonfig wizard on start up.
* Fixed deadlock on Windows when runing subprocess that generates enough output
  to fill the OS pipe buffer.
* Sourcing foreign shells will now return a non-zero exit code if the
  source operation failed for some reason.
* Fixed PermissionError when running commands in directories without read permissions
* Prevent Windows fixups from overriding environment vars in static config

**Security:** None


v0.2.7
====================
**Added:**

* Added new valid ``$SHELL_TYPE`` called ``'best'``. This selects the best value
  for the concrete shell type based on the availability on the user's machine.
* New environment variable ``$XONSH_COLOR_STYLE`` will set the color mapping
  for all of xonsh.
* New ``XonshStyle`` pygments style will determine the approriate color
  mapping based on ``$XONSH_COLOR_STYLE``.  The associated ``xonsh_style_proxy()``
  is intended for wrapping ``XonshStyle`` when actually being used by
  pygments.
* The functions ``print_color()`` and ``format_color()`` found in ``xonsh.tools``
  dispatch to the approriate shell color handling and may be used from
  anywhere.
* ``xonsh.tools.HAVE_PYGMENTS`` flag now denotes if pygments is installed and
  available on the users system.
* The ``ansi_colors`` module is now availble for handling ANSI color codes.
* ``?`` and ``??`` operator output now has colored titles, like in IPython.
* ``??`` will syntax highlight source code if pygments is available.
* Python mode output is now syntax highlighted if pygments is available.
* New ``$RIGHT_PROMPT`` environment variable for displaying right-aligned
  text in prompt-toolkit shell.
* Added ``!(...)`` operator, which returns an object representing the result
  of running a command.  The truth value of this object is True if the
  return code is equal to zero and False otherwise.
* Optional dependency on the win_unicode_console package to enable unicode
  support in cmd.exe on Windows. This can be disabled/enabled with the
  ``$WIN_UNICODE_CONSOLE`` environment variable.

**Changed:**

* Updated ``$SHELL_TYPE`` default to ``'best'``.
* Shell classes are now responsible for implementing their own color
  formatting and printing.
* Prompt coloring, history diffing, and tracing uses new color handling
  capabilities.
* New ``Token.Color`` token for xonsh color names, e.g. we now use
  ``Token.Color.RED`` rather than ``Token.RED``.
* Untracked files in git are ignored when determining if a git workdir is
  is dirty. This affects the coloring of the branch label.
* Regular expression globbing now uses ``re.fullmatch`` instead of
  ``re.match``, and the result of an empty regex glob does not cause the
  argument to be deleted.


**Removed:**

* The ``xonsh.tools.TERM_COLORS`` mapping has been axed, along with all
  references to it. This may cause a problem if you were using a raw color code
  in your xonshrc file from ``$FORMATTER_DICT``. To fix, simply remove these
  references.

**Fixed:**

* Multidimensional slicing, as in numpy, no longer throws SyntaxErrors.
* Some minor zsh fixes for more platforms and setups.
* The ``BaseShell.settitle`` method no longer has its commands captured by
  ``$(...)``



v0.2.6
====================
**Added:**

* ``trace`` alias added that enables users to turn on and off the printing
  of source code lines prior to their execution. This is useful for debugging scripts.
* New ability to force callable alias functions to be run in the foreground, i.e.
  the main thread from which the function was called. This is useful for debuggers
  and profilers which may require such access. Use the ``xonsh.proc.foreground``
  decorator on an alias function to flag it. ``ForegroundProcProxy`` and
  ``SimpleForegroundProcProxy`` classes have been added to support this feature.
  Normally, forcing a foreground alias is not needed.
* Added boolean ``$RAISE_SUBPROC_ERROR`` environment variable. If true
  and a subprocess command exits with a non-zero return code, a
  CalledProcessError will be raised. This is useful in scripts that should
  fail at the first error.
* If the ``setproctitle`` package is installed, the process title will be
  set to ``'xonsh'`` rather than the path to the Python interpreter.
* zsh foreign shell interface now supported natively in xonsh, like with Bash.
  New ``source-zsh`` alias allows easy access to zsh scripts and functions.
* Vox virtual environment manager added.

**Changed:**

* The ``foreign_shell_data()`` keyword arguments ``envcmd`` and ``aliascmd``
  now default to ``None``.
* Updated alias docs to pull in usage from the commands automatically.

**Fixed:**

* Hundreds of bugs related to line and column numbers have been addressed.
* Fixed path completion not working for absolute paths or for expanded paths on Windows.
* Fixed issue with hg dirty branches and $PATH.
* Fixed issues related to foreign shell data in files with whitespace in the names.
* Worked around bug in ConEmu/cmder which prevented ``get_git_branch()``
  from working in these terminal emulators on Windows.


v0.2.5
===========
**Added:**

* New configuration utility 'xonfig' which reports current system
  setup information and creates config files through an interactive
  wizard.
* Toolkit for creating wizards now available
* timeit and which aliases will now complete their arguments.
* $COMPLETIONS_MENU_ROWS environment variable controls the size of the
  tab-completion menu in prompt-toolkit.
* Prompt-toolkit shell now supports true multiline input with the ability
  to scroll up and down in the prompt.

**Changed:**

* The xonfig wizard will run on interactive startup if no configuration
  file is found.
* BaseShell now has a singleline() method for prompting a single input.
* Environment variable docs are now auto-generated.
* Prompt-toolkit shell will now dynamically allocate space for the
  tab-completion menu.
* Looking up nonexistent environment variables now generates an error
  in Python mode, but produces a sane default value in subprocess mode.
* Environments are now considered to contain all manually-adjusted keys,
  and also all keys with an associated default value.

**Removed:**

* Removed ``xonsh.ptk.shortcuts.Prompter.create_prompt_layout()`` and
  ``xonsh.ptk.shortcuts.Prompter.create_prompt_application()`` methods
  to reduce portion of xonsh that forks prompt-toolkit. This may require
  users to upgrade to prompt-toolkit v0.57+.

**Fixed:**

* First prompt in the prompt-toolkit shell now allows for up and down
  arrows to search through history.
* Made obtaining the prompt-toolkit buffer thread-safe.
* Now always set non-detypable environment variables when sourcing
  foreign shells.
* Fixed issue with job management if a TTY existed but was not controlled
  by the process, posix only.
* Jupyter kernel no longer times out when using foreign shells on startup.
* Capturing redirections, e.g. ``$(echo hello > f.txt)``, no longer fails
  with a decoding error.
* Evaluation in a Jupyter cell will return pformatted object.
* Jupyter with redirect uncaptured subprocs to notebook.
* Tab completion in Jupyter fixed.
